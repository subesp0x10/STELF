Worker - a worker is an object that processes data.
	Properties:
		data_prefix: Character appended to start of message to denote which worker should process it.
		input_queue: Queue of messages to be processed by a worker.
	Functions:
		send (data): Places data on queue to be sent to attacker machine.
		put (data):  Puts data on input queue to be processed.
		run ():		 Function called upon start of worker. Should be an infinite loop, which takes data from input_queue, processes it and places output on 			 output queue.
		
Example flow of data:
	1. Attacker types in a command such as 'whoami'
	2. Command is placed on output queue with a prefix of chr(1), denoting it is to be handled by UserInputWorker.
	3. Transmit worker grabs it from queue and sends it to the shell.
	4. Shell receives the command, reads the prefix, removes it and places it on UserInputWorker queue.
	5. Worker grabs the command from queue, executes it, and places output on output_queue with prefix of chr(1) again.
	6. Transmit worker takes it and sends it back to the attacker.
	7. Attacker receives it and places the message in UserInputWorker.
	8. UserInputWorker gets output from its queue and displays it to the attacker.
