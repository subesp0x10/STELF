## Well, hello.

This readme is written by Pry0cc because Jschmoe couldn't be bothered to make one.

### So how the hell do I use this?...

On the attacker machine, run handler.py

On the victim host run shell.py

The connect back details are located in defines.py

I have no idea if crypto works. (it does you dingus)
